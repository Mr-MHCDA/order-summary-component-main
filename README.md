### Built with

- what i've learnt from this project is that when devloping web pages it has to be from ground up like it has to be writtened one by one and detaily.

### Useful resources

- [MDN web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This Helps me to refer codes and examples more detail way than others with live examples and other referances
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - this helps to pic a font with speific weight of font and on top of all multiple weights to embed inside the web page and plus to that the page provides the code to put in to your html and css.
